# Help
My name is PublicStaticVoidKID, and I am a university student. I am writing to request your help with my final programming project. I speak Spanish, and my code is in Spanish (labels, options, etc.). Unfortunately, the active Spanish-speaking community is scarce, so I am coming to you for help.
My teammates abandoned the project and removed me from the group, so I am now working on it on my own. I only need two points to pass the course, so I am doing everything I can to finish the project on time. However, I have not been sleeping well in recent days, and some things are not going as I expected.
In particular, I am having problems with the code. I feel like it is very messy and some things are not working properly. For example, when I try to sell tickets for the two latest movies, the base price is zero. Additionally, the price is not increasing correctly depending on the format chosen. I also have problems generating reports.
Finally, the interface is not the best, but I made it as quickly as possible.
The project is due on Tuesday, and I have an exam tomorrow. I know that I will not be able to finish it on time on my own, so I am asking for your help.
If you could review my code and offer me some advice or fix it, I would be very grateful.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, PublicStaticVoidKID
